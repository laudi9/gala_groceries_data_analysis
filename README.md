# gala_groceries_data_analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Gala Groceries Data Analysis Project README! In this project, we aim to help Gala Groceries, a technology-driven grocery store chain in the USA, optimize their supply chain operations by accurately predicting stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data. Gala Groceries is committed to providing high-quality, fresh produce from local suppliers, and they believe that data-driven insights can help them achieve this goal.

## Problem Statement
The primary problem statement for this project is:

**"Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?"** 

To address this problem, we will analyze sales, sensor, and stock data to develop predictive models that can inform Gala Groceries' procurement decisions. We will focus on the following datasets and data sources:

1. **Sales Data:** This dataset contains historical sales data, including product information, timestamps, and quantities sold.

2. **Sensor Data:** Sensor data includes temperature measurements from storage facilities in the warehouse.
   
3. **Stock Data:** The dataset holds information on the product, timestamps, and the estimated stock percentage.

## Project Plan
To successfully address the problem statement, we have outlined the following strategic plan:

#### 1. Data Collection and Exploration
**Data Gathering:** Collect and consolidate the sales, sensor, and stock data from relevant sources within the organization.

**Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the datasets, identify missing values, and gain initial insights into the data.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
**Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the datasets by handling missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.

**Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features from the data that can be used for modeling, such as date-related features and product categories.

#### 3. Data Modeling
**Machine Learning Models:** Develop machine learning models, such as Random Forest Regressor and Feature Importances, to predict stock levels based on sales and sensor data.

**Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

#### 4. Visualization and Interpretation
**Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to present insights and predictions to stakeholders effectively.

**Interpretation:** Interpret model results and provide actionable recommendations for procurement and inventory management.

#### 5. Documentation and Reporting
**Documentation:** Maintain clear and well-documented code throughout the project.
